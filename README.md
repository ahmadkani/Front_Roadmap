# Front End Roadmap

### What Makes This Roadmap Unique?

Unlike other roadmaps, this one combines:

- **Clear, Simple Structure**: All resources are organized into one easy-to-read file.
- **Curated, High-Quality Resources**: Each topic includes trusted resources to help you learn effectively without the clutter.
- **Collaborative, Open-Source Approach**: This roadmap is community-driven, so it stays current and reflects what works best for real front-end developers.
- **Limit on Courses per Level**: For each topic and skill level, we recommend **3 to 5 high-quality courses**. This ensures that users have enough options to choose from without feeling overwhelmed. Each course should bring unique value or perspective to the topic, covering essential concepts without redundancy.
  By keeping this limit, we can focus on quality over quantity and maintain a clear, streamlined learning path for all users.

### How It Works

We’ve organized each major front-end topic—such as **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and more—into three skill levels:

- **Beginner**: For those just starting out with foundational concepts.
- **Intermediate**: For developers ready to deepen their knowledge and refine their skills.
- **Deep & Advanced**: For front-end engineers who want to master complex topics and specialized areas.

Within each level, you’ll find carefully selected courses, tutorials, and projects, so you know exactly where to start and how to level up.

### Get Involved!

This roadmap is open for contributions, so feel free to share your favorite resources or suggest improvements. Together, we’re creating a comprehensive, go-to resource for front-end developers everywhere!

## Contribution Guidelines

Want to contribute? Awesome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Add Trusted Resources**: Make sure the resources are high-quality and relevant to front-end development.
2. **Use Appropriate Levels**: Add resources to the Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced sections based on their difficulty.
3. **Provide a Short Description**: Include a one-line description of the resource to help users understand its focus.
4. **Format**: Follow the formatting used in the file for consistency.

### Review Process

All contributions are reviewed to ensure they align with the roadmap's standards and quality goals. After you submit a change, the team will review it and provide feedback or suggestions if needed.

Together, we can make this roadmap a valuable resource for front-end developers everywhere!

  🙍🏻‍♂️ _Instructor: Will Sentance_ <br>

  - **[JavaScript The Hard Parts,V2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/)** <br>
    🙍🏻‍♂️ _Instructor: Will Sentance_ <br>
    ⏰ _6 hours, 41 minutes_ <br>
    📝 _Go under the hood of some of the most important aspects of JavaScript! You'll learn what you need to know to become a sought-after, versatile, problem-solving developer. Combining mental models of JavaScript's inner workings and hands-on programming challenges, this course will give you a solid understanding of callbacks and higher-order functions, closure, asynchronous JavaScript, and object-oriented JavaScript! This course is for developers with a basic to intermediate knowledge of JavaScript who wants to deepen their understanding of the fundamentals to the next level._
